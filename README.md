## Hey ðŸ‘‹, This is Kean Shi

Iâ€™m currently a undergraduated student in Tianjin University, majoring in Computer Science. I was advised by Prof. Wenjun Wang during 2022 - 2024. Next year I will pursue my masterâ€™s degree in Peking Unversity, advised by Prof. Baobao Chang.

My research interest includes **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM), Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)**, etc.
