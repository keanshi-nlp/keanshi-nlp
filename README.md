## Hey 👋, This is Kean Shi

Hello! I am Kean Shi (石珂安), a first-year master student at Peking University (School of Computer Science), supervised by Prof. Baobao Chang. Before that. I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science from Tianjin University in 2025.

My research interests lie in the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)** and **GUI Agent**.
